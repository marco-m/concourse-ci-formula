  # NOTE 'concourse web' went back and forth with option `--external-url` being sometimes
  # mandatory and sometimes optional. It became mandatory again with Concourse 4.x.
  # It has the following characteristics:
  # 1. Cannot be loopback (reason of "external" in the name).
  # 2. Must be reachable from the host, so on VirtualBox it cannot be the address
  #    of the first guest interface (eth0) plus VirtualBox port forwarding of 8080
  # This means that unfortunately we need a separate interface (which by itself is not
  # a problem; it becomes a problem because we want to use the same SaltStack configuration
  # both for VirtualBox and for AMI, and for the AMI we want only one interface).

  # Ideally we would like to use VirtualBox DHCP to assign an address:
  #config.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"
  # but it doesn't work for some reasons I don't understand, so we are stuck with
  # an hard-coded IP address
